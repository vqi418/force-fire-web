       <h3>Liber CI</h3><h1>O.T.O.<br/>An Open Letter to Those Who May Wish to Join the Order</h1>

<p class="elab">Enumerating the Duties and Privileges</p>
<p><em>These Regulations Come into Force in Any District Where the Membership of the Order Exceeds One Thousand Souls</em></p>

<span><strong>Issued by Order:</strong></span> <span class="subtitle">BAPHOMET XI&deg; O.T.O.,<br>
HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUM BRITANNIARUM, REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUS</span>
<br><br>
<p><em>An Epistle of BAPHOMET to Sir GEORGE MACNIE COWIE, Very
  Illustrious and Very Illuminated, Pontiff and Epopt of the Areopagus of the
  VIII</em>&deg;<em> O.T.O., Grand Treasurer General, Keeper of the Golden Book,
    President of the Committee of Publications of the O.T.O.</em></p>
<br>

<p class="ctr">Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>

<p>It has been represented to Us that some persons who are worthy to join the
O.T.O. consider the fees and subscriptions rather high. This is due to your
failure to explain properly the great advantages offered by the Order. We
desire you therefore presently to note, and to cause to be circulated
throughout the Order, and among those of the profane who may seem worthy to
join it, these matters following concerning the duties and the privileges of
members of the earlier degrees of the O.T.O. as regards material affairs. And
for convenience we shall classify these as pertaining to the Twelve Houses of
the Heaven, but also by numbered clauses for the sake of such as understand not
the so-called Science of the Stars. First, therefore, concerning the duties of
the Brethren. Yet with our Order every duty is also a privilege, so that it is
impossible wholly to separate them.</p>

<p class="section">Of the Duties of the Brethren</p>

<p class="subsection">First House</p>

<p class="ind">1. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. Yet it is well for
Brethren to study daily in the Volume of the Sacred Law, <em>Liber Legis</em>,
for therein is much counsel concerning this, how best they may carry out this
will.</p>

<p class="subsection">Second House</p>

<p class="ind">2. The private purse of every Brother should always be at the
disposal of any Brother who may be in need. But in such a case it is a great
mischief if the one ask, and the other consent; for if the former be really in
need, his pride is wounded by his asking; and if not, the door is opened to
beggars and imposters, and all manner of arrant knaves and rogues such as are
no true Brethren. But the Brother who is possessed of this world's goods
should make it his business to watch the necessity of all those Brethren with
whom he may be personally acquainted, anticipating their wants in so wise and
kindly and delicate a manner that it shall appear as if it were the payment of
a debt. And what help is given shall be given with discretion, so that the
relief may be permanent rather than temporary.</p>

<p class="ind">3. All Brethren shall be exceedingly punctual in the payment of
Lodge Dues. This is to take precedence of all other calls upon the purse.</p>

<p class="subsection">Third House</p>

<p class="ind">4. The Brethren shall be diligent in preaching the Law of
Thelema. In all writings they shall be careful to use the prescribed greetings;
likewise in speech, even with strangers.</p>

<p class="ind">5. They shall respond heartily to every summons of the Lodge or
Chapter to which they may belong, not lightly making excuse.</p>

<p class="ind">6. Brethren should use every opportunity of assisting each other
in their tastes, businesses, or professions, whether by direct dealing with
Brethren in preference to others, or by speaking well of them, or as may
suggest itself. It seems desirable, when possible, that where two or more
Brethren of the same Lodge are engaged in the same work, they should seek to
amalgamate the same by entering into partnership. Thus in time great and
powerful corporations may arise from small individual enterprises.</p>

<p class="ind">7. They shall be diligent in circulating all tracts, manifestos,
and all other communications which the Order may from time to time give out for
the instruction or emancipation of the profane.</p>

<p class="ind">8. They may offer suitable books and pictures to the Libraries of
the Profess-Houses of the Order.</p>

<p class="subsection">Fourth House</p>

<p class="ind">9. Every Brother who may possess mines, land, or houses more
than he can himself constantly occupy, should donate part of such mines or
land, or one or more of such houses to the Order.</p>

<p class="ind">10. Property thus given will be administered if he desire it in
his own interest, thus effecting a saving, since large estates are more
economically handled than small. But the Order will use such property as may
happen to lie idle for the moment in such ways as it may seem good, lending an
unlet house (for example) to some Brother who is in need, or allowing an unused
hall to be occupied by a Lodge.</p>

<p class="ind">11. (Yet in view of the great objects of the Order, endowment is
welcome.)</p>

<p class="ind">12. Every Brother shall show himself solicitous of the comfort
and happiness of any Brother who may be old, attending not only to all material
wants, but to his amusement, so that his declining years may be made
joyful.</p>

<p class="subsection">Fifth House</p>

<p class="ind">13. Every Brother shall seek constantly to give pleasure to all
Brethren with whom he is acquainted, whether by entertainment or conversation,
or in any other manner that may suggest itself. It will frequently and
naturally arise that love itself springs up between members of the Order, for
that they have so many and so sacred interests in common. Such love is
peculiarly holy, and is to be encouraged.</p>

<p class="ind">14. All children of Brethren are to be considered as children of
the whole Order, and to be protected and aided in every way by its members
severally, as by its organization collectively. No distinction is to be made
with regard to the conditions surrounding the birth of any child.</p>

<p class="ind">15. There is an especially sacred duty, which every Brother
should fulfil, with regard to all children, those born without the Order
included. This duty is to instruct them in the Law of Thelema, to teach them
independence and freedom of thought and character, and to warn them that
servility and cowardice are the most deadly diseases of the human soul.</p>

<p class="subsection">Sixth House</p>

<p class="ind">16. Personal or domestic attendants should be chosen from among
the members of the Order when possible, and great tact and courtesy are to be
employed in dealing with them.</p>

<p class="ind">17. They, on their part, will render willing and intelligent
service.</p>

<p class="ind">18. While in Lodge, and on special occasions, they are to be
treated as Brothers, with perfect equality; such behaviour is undesirable
during the hours of service, and familiarity, subversive as it is of all
discipline and order, is to be avoided by adopting a complete and marked change
of manner and address.</p>

<p class="ind">19. This applies to all persons in subordinate positions, but not
to the Brethren Servient in the Profess-Houses of the Order, who, giving
service without recompense, are to be honoured as hosts.</p>

<p class="ind">20. In case of the sickness of any Brother, it is the duty of all
Brethren who know him personally to attend him, to see that he want for
nothing, and to report if necessary his needs to the Lodge, or to Grand Lodge
itself.</p>

<p class="ind">21. Those Brethren who happen to be doctors or nurses will
naturally give their skill and care with even more than their customary joy in
service.</p>

<p class="ind">22. All Brethren are bound by their fealty to offer their service
in their particular trade, business, or profession, to the Grand Lodge. For
example, a stationer will supply Grand Lodge with paper, vellum, and the like;
a bookseller offer any books to the Library of Grand Lodge which the Librarian
may desire to possess; a lawyer will execute any legal business for Grand
Lodge, and a railway or steamship owner or director see to it that the Great
Officers travel in comfort wherever they may wish to go.</p>

<p class="ind">23. Visitors from other Lodges are to be accorded the treatment
of ambassadors; this will apply most especially to Sovereign Grand Inspector
Generals of the Order on their tours of inspection. All hospitality and
courtesy shown to such is shown to Ourselves, not to them only.</p>

<p class="subsection">Seventh House</p>

<p class="ind">24. It is desirable that the marriage partner of any Brother
should also be a member of the Order. Neglect to insist upon this leads
frequently to serious trouble for both parties, especially the uninitiate.</p>

<p class="ind">25. Lawsuits between members of the Order are absolutely
forbidden, on pain of immediate expulsion and loss of all privileges, even of
those accumulated by past good conduct referred to in the second part of this
instruction.</p>

<p class="ind">26. All disputes between Brethren should be referred firstly to
the Master or Masters of their Lodge or Lodges in conference; if a composition
be not arrived at in this manner, the dispute is to be referred to the Grand
Tribunal, which will arbitrate thereon, and its decision is to be accepted as
final.</p>

<p class="ind">27. Refusal to apply for or to accept such decision shall entail
expulsion from the Order, and the other party is then at liberty to seek his
redress in the Courts of Profane Justice.</p>

<p class="ind">28. Members of the Order are to regard those without its pale as
possessing no rights of any kind, since they have not accepted the Law, and are
therefore, as it were, troglodytes, survivals of a past civilisation, and to be
treated accordingly. Kindness should be shown towards them, as towards any
other animal, and every effort should be made to bring them into Freedom.</p>

<p class="ind">29. Any injury done by any person without the Order to any person
within it may be brought before the Grand Tribunal, which will, if it deem
right and fit, use all its power to redress or to avenge it.</p>

<p class="ind">30. In the case of any Brother being accused of an offence
against the criminal law of the country in which he resides, so that any other
Brother cognisant of the fact feels bound in self-defence to bring accusation,
he shall report the matter to the Grand Tribunal as well as to the Civil
Authority, claiming exemption on this ground.</p>

<p class="ind">31. The accused Brother will, however, be defended by the Order
to the utmost of its power on his affirming his innocence upon the Volume of
the Sacred Law in the Ordeal appointed <em>ad hoc</em> by the Grand Tribunal
itself.</p>

<p class="ind">32. Public enemies of the country of any Brother shall be treated
as such while in the field, and slain or captured as the officer of the Brother
may command. But within the precincts of the Lodge all such divisions are to be
forgotten absolutely; and as children of One Father the enemies of the hour
before and the hour after are to dwell in peace, amity, and fraternity.</p>

<p class="subsection">Eighth House</p>

<p class="ind">33. Every Brother is expected to bear witness in his last will
and testament to the great benefit that he hath received from the Order by
bestowing upon it part or the whole of his goods, as he may deem fit.</p>

<p class="ind">34. The death of a Brother is not to be an occasion of
melancholy, but of rejoicing; the Brethren of his Lodge shall gather together
and make a banquet with music and dancing and all manner of gladness. It is of
the greatest importance that this shall be done, for thereby the inherited fear
of death which is deep-seated as instinct in us will gradually be rooted out.
It is a legacy from the dead &aelig;on of Osiris, and it is our duty to kill it
in ourselves that our children and our children's children may be born
free from the curse.</p>

<p class="subsection">Ninth House</p>

<p class="ind">35. Every Brother is expected to spend a great part of his spare
time in the study of the principles of the Law and of the Order, and in
searching out the key to its great and manifold mysteries.</p>

<p class="ind">36. He should also do all in his power to spread the Law,
especially taking long journeys, when possible, to remote places, there to sow
the seed of the Law.</p>

<p class="subsection">Tenth House</p>

<p class="ind">37. All pregnant women are especially sacred to members of the
Order, and no effort should be spared to bring them to acceptance of the Law of
Freedom, so that the unborn may benefit by that impression. They should be
induced to become members of the Order, so that the child may be born under its
&aelig;gis.</p>

<p class="ind">38. If the mother that is to be have asserted her will to be so
in contempt and defiance of the Tabus of the slave-gods, she is to be regarded
as especially suitable to our Order, and the Master of the Lodge in her
district shall offer to become, as it were, godfather to the child, who shall
be trained specially, if the mother so wishes, as a servant of the Order, in
one of its Profess-Houses.</p>

<p class="ind">39. Special Profess-Houses for the care of women of the Order, or
those whose husbands or lovers are members of the Order, will be instituted, so
that the frontal duty of womankind may be carried out in all comfort and
honour.</p>

<p class="ind">40. Every Brother is expected to use all his influence with
persons in a superior station of life (so called) to induce them to join the
Order. Royal personages, ministers of State, high officials in the Diplomatic,
Naval, Military, and Civil Services are particularly to be sought after, for it
is intended ultimately that the temporal power of the State be brought into the
Law, and led into freedom and prosperity by the application of its
principles.</p>

<p class="ind">41. Colleges of the Order will presently be established where the
children of its members may be trained in all trades, businesses, and
professions, and there they may study the liberal arts and humane letters, as
well as our holy and arcane science. Brethren are expected to do all in their
power to make possible the establishment of such Universities.</p>

<p class="subsection">Eleventh House</p>

<p class="ind">42. Every Brother is expected to do all in his power to induce
his personal friends to accept the Law and join the Order. He should therefore
endeavour to make new friends outside the Order, for the purpose of widening
its scope.</p>

<p class="subsection">Twelfth House</p>

<p class="ind">43. The Brethren are bound to secrecy only with regard to the
nature of the rituals of our Order, and to our words, signs, <em>etc.</em> The
general principles of the Order may be fully explained, so far as they are
understood below the VI&deg;; as it is written, "The ordeals I write not:
the rituals shall be half known and half concealed: the Law is for all."
It is to be observed that punctual performance of these duties, so that the
report thereof is noised abroad and the fame of it cometh even unto the Throne
of the Supreme and Holy King himself, will weigh heavily in the scale when it
comes to be a question of the high advancement of a Brother in the Order.</p>

<p class="section">Of the Privileges of the Brethren</p>

<p class="subsection">First House</p>

<p class="ind">44. The first and greatest of all privileges of a Brother is to
be a Brother; to have accepted the Law, to have become free and independent, to
have destroyed all fear, whether of custom, or of faith, or of other men, or of
death itself. In other papers the joy and glory of those who have accepted
<em>The Book of the Law</em> as the sole rule of life is largely, though never
fully, explained; and we will not here recapitulate the same.</p>

<p class="subsection">Second House</p>

<p class="ind">45. All Brethren who may fall into indigence have a right to the
direct assistance of the Order up to the full amount of fees and subscriptions
paid by them up to the time of application. This will be regarded as a loan,
but no interest will be charged upon it. That this privilege may not be abused,
the Grand Tribunal will decide whether or no such application is made in good
faith.</p>

<p class="subsection">Third House</p>

<p class="ind">46. Members of the Order will be permitted to use the Library in
any of our Profess-Houses.</p>

<p class="ind">47. Circulating Libraries will presently be established.</p>

<p class="ind">48. Brethren who may be travelling have a right to the
hospitality of the Master of the Lodge of the district for a period of three
days.</p>

<p class="subsection">Fourth House</p>

<p class="ind">49. Brethren of all grades may be invited to sojourn in the
Profess-Houses of the Order by Grand Lodge; and such invitation may confidently
be expected as the reward of merit. There they will be able to make the
personal acquaintance of members of the higher Grades, learn of the deeper
workings of the Order, obtain the benefit of personal instruction, and in all
ways fit themselves for advancement.</p>

<p class="ind">50. Brethren of advanced years and known merit who desire to
follow the religious life may be asked to reside permanently in such
houses.</p>

<p class="ind">51. In the higher degrees Brethren have the right to reside in
our Profess-Houses for a portion of every year, as shown:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="offset-by-two two columns">VI&deg;.</div>
  <div class="three columns">Two weeks.</div>
  <div class="two columns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII&deg;.</div>
  <div class="three columns">Two months.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="offset-by-two two columns">G.T.</div>
  <div class="three columns">One month.</div>
  <div class="two columns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.G.C.</div>
  <div class="three columns">Three months.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="offset-by-two two columns">P.R.S.</div>
  <div class="three columns">Six weeks.</div>
  <div class="two columns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII&deg;.</div>
  <div class="three columns">Six months.</div>
</div>

<p class="ind">52. Members of the IX&deg;, who share among themselves the whole
property of the Order according to the rules of that degree, may, of course,
reside there permanently. Indeed, the house of every Brother of this grade is,
<em>ipso facto,</em> a Profess-House of the Order.</p>

<p class="subsection">Fifth House</p>

<p class="ind">53. All Brethren may expect the warmest co-operation in their
pleasures and amusements from other members of the Order. The perfect freedom
and security afforded by the Law allows the characters of all Brethren to
expand to the very limits of their nature, and the great joy and gladness with
which they are constantly overflowing make them the best of companions.
"They shall rejoice, our chosen; who sorroweth is not of us. Beauty and
strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of
us."</p>

<p class="ind">54. Children of all Brethren are entitled to the care of the
Order, and arrangements will be made to educate them in certain of the
Profess-Houses of the Order.</p>

<p class="ind">55. Children of Brethren who are left orphans will be officially
adopted by the Master of his Lodge, or if the latter decline, by the Supreme
Holy King himself, and treated in all ways as if they were his own.</p>

<p class="ind">56. Brethren who have a right to some especial interest in any
child whose mother is not a member of the Order may recommend it especially to
the care of their lodges or of Grand Lodge.</p>

<p class="subsection">Sixth House</p>

<p class="ind">57. In sickness all Brethren have the right to medical or
surgical care and attendance from any Brethren of the Lodge who may be
physicians, surgeons, or nurses.</p>

<p class="ind">58. In special necessity the Supreme Holy King will send his own
attendants.</p>

<p class="ind">59. Where circumstances warrant it, in cases of lives of great
value to the Order and the like, he may even permit the administration of that
secret Medicine which is known to members of the IX&deg;.</p>

<p class="ind">60. Members of the Order may expect Brethren to busy themselves
in finding remunerative occupation for them, where they lack it, or, if
possible, to employ them personally.</p>

<p class="subsection">Seventh House</p>

<p class="ind">61. Members of the Order may expect to find suitable marriage
partners in the extremely select body to which they belong. Community of
interest and hope being already established, it is natural to suppose that
where mutual attraction also exists, a marriage will result in perfect
happiness. (There are special considerations in this matter which apply to the
VII&deg; and cannot be discussed in this place.)</p>

<p class="ind">62. As explained above, Brethren are entirely free of most legal
burdens, since lawsuits are not permitted within the Order, and since they may
call upon the legal advisers of the Order to defend them against their enemies
in case of need.</p>

<p class="subsection">Eighth House</p>

<p class="ind">63. All Brethren are entitled after death to the proper disposal
of their remains according to the rites of the Order and their grade in it.</p>

<p class="ind">64. If the Brother so desire, the entire amount of the fees and
subscriptions which he has paid during his life will be handed over by the
Order to his heirs and legatees. The Order thus affords an absolute system of
insurance in addition to its other benefits.</p>

<p class="subsection">Ninth House</p>

<p class="ind">65. The Order teaches the only perfect and satisfactory system
of philosophy, religion, and science, leading its members step by step to
knowledge and power hardly even dreamed of by the profane.</p>

<p class="ind">66. Brethren of the Order who take long journeys overseas are
received in places where they sojourn at the Profess-Houses of the Order for
the period of one month.</p>

<p class="subsection">Tenth House</p>

<p class="ind">67. Women of the Order who are about to become mothers receive
all care, attention, and honour from all Brethren.</p>

<p class="ind">68. Special Profess-Houses will be established for their
convenience, should they wish to take advantage of them.</p>

<p class="ind">69. The Order offers great social advantages to its members,
bringing them as it does into constant association with men and women of high
rank.</p>

<p class="ind">70. The Order offers extraordinary opportunities to its members
in their trades, businesses, or professions, aiding them by co-operation, and
securing them clients or customers.</p>

<p class="subsection">Eleventh House</p>

<p class="ind">71. The Order offers friendship to its members, bringing
together men and women of similar character, taste, and aspiration.</p>

<p class="subsection">Twelfth House</p>

<p class="ind">72. The secrecy of the Order provides its members with an
inviolable shroud of concealment.</p>

<p class="ind">73. The crime of slander, which causes so great a proportion of
human misery, is rendered extremely dangerous, if not impossible, within the
Order by a clause in the Obligation of the Third Degree.</p>

<p class="ind">74. The Order exercises its whole power to relieve its members of
any constraint to which they may be subjected, attacking with vigour any person
or persons who may endeavour to subject them to compulsion, and in all other
ways aiding in the complete emancipation of the Brethren from aught that may
seek to restrain them from doing That Which They Will.</p>

<p class="ind">It is to be observed that these privileges being so vast, it is
incumbent upon the honour of every Brother not to abuse them, and the sponsors
of any Brother who does so, as well as he himself, will be held strictly to
account by the Grand Tribunal. The utmost frankness and good faith between
Brethren is essential to the easy and harmonious working of our system, and the
Executive Power will see to it that these are encouraged by all possible means,
and that breach of them is swiftly and silently suppressed.</p>

<p class="ctr">Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<p>Our fatherly benediction, and the Blessing of the All-Father in the Outer and the Inner
be upon you.</p>
