in Assyrian and Greek by The Master Therion</em></p>


<h3 class="section">I<br/>
Of the Furnishings of the Temple</h3>

<p class="ind">In the East, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which is
situated on the South-Eastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland, two miles
east of Foyers, is a shrine or High Altar. Its dimensions should be
seven feet in length, three feet in breadth, 44 inches in height. It
should be covered with a crimson altar-cloth, on which may be
embroidered fleur-de-lys in gold, or a sunblaze, or other suitable
emblem.</p>

<p class="ind">On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk, with
countercharges in black and white.</p>

<p class="ind">Below it should be the dais of three steps, in black and white
squares.</p>

<p class="ind">Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the Stèle of
Revealing in reproduction, with four candles on each side of it. Below the
stèle is a place for <em>The Book of the Law</em>, with six candles on each side
of it. Below this again is the Holy Graal, with roses on each side of it. There
is room in front of the Cup for the Paten. On each side beyond the roses are
two great candles.</p>

<p class="ind">All this is enclosed within a great Veil.</p>

<p class="ind">Forming the apex of an equilateral triangle whose base is a line
drawn between the pillars, is a small black square altar, of two superimposed
cubes.</p>

<p class="ind">Taking this altar as the middle of the base of a similar and
equal triangle, at the apex of this second triangle is a small circular
font.</p>

<p class="ind">Repeating, the apex of a third triangle is an upright tomb.</p>


<p class="section">II<br/>
Of the Officers of the Mass</p>

<p class="ind">The PRIEST. Bears the Sacred Lance, and is clothed at first in a
plain white robe.</p>

<p class="ind">The PRIESTESS. Should be actually Virgo Intacta or specially
dedicated to the service of the Great Order. She is clothed in white, blue, and
gold. She bears the Sword from a red girdle, and the Paten and Hosts, or Cakes
of Light.</p>

<p class="ind">The DEACON. He is clothed in white and yellow. He bears <em>The
Book of the Law</em>.</p>

<p class="ind">Two CHILDREN. They are clothed in white and black. One bears a
pitcher of water and a cellar of salt, the other a censer of fire and a casket
of perfume.</p>


<p class="section">III<br/>
Of the Ceremony of the Introit</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> DEACON,<em> opening the door of the Temple, admits the
congregation and takes his stand between the small altar and the font.
(There should be a doorkeeper to attend to the admission.) The</em> DEACON
<em>advances and bows before the open shrine where the Graal is exalted. He
kisses</em> The Book of the Law <em>three times, opens it, and places it
upon the super-altar. He turns West.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>The</em> DEACON:</strong> Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the
  Law. I proclaim the Law of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty in the name of ʼΙΑΩ.</p>
  
<p><b><em>The</em> CONGREGATION:</b> Love is the law, love under will.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> DEACON <em>goes to his place between the altar of incense and
the font, faces East, and gives the step and sign of a Man and a Brother. All
imitate him.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> DEACON<em> and all the</em> PEOPLE:</b>

I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in
the Company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall
return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the
sole viceregent of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all
that breathes.</p>

<p class="ind">And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb
wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery,
in Her name BABALON.</p>

<p class="ind">And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in
His name BAPHOMET.</p>

<p class="ind">And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life,
Love and Liberty, the Word of whose Law is ΘΕΛΗΜΑ.</p>

<p class="ind">And I believe in the communion of Saints.</p>

<p class="ind">And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into
spiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.</p>

<p class="ind">And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the
Miracle of Incarnation.</p>

<p class="ind">And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and
is, and is to come.</p>

<p class="ind">ʼΆΥΜΓΝ. ʼΆΥΜΓΝ. ʼΆΥΜΓΝ.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Music is now played. The child enters with the ewer and the
salt. The</em> VIRGIN <em>enters with the Sword and the Paten. The child enters with the
censer and the perfume. They face the</em> DEACON, <em>deploying into line from the
space between the two altars.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> VIRGIN:</b> Greeting of Earth and Heaven!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>All give the Hailing sign of a Magician, the</em> DEACON
<em>leading.</em></p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIESTESS, <em>the negative child on her left, the positive
child on her right, ascends the steps of the High Altar. They await her below.
She places the Paten before the Graal. Having adored it, she descends, and with
the children following her, the positive next her, she moves in a serpentine
manner involving 3½ circles of the Temple. (Deosil about altar, widdershins
about font, deosil about altar and font, widdershins about altar, and so to the
Tomb in the West.) She draws her Sword and pulls down the Veil
therewith.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIESTESS:</b> By the power of &#x2629; Iron, I
say unto thee, Arise. In the name of our Lord &#x2629; the Sun, and
of our Lord &#x2629; ... that thou mayst administer the virtues to
the Brethren.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>She sheathes the Sword.</em></p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIEST, <em>issuing from the Tomb, holding the Lance erect
with both hands, right over left, against his breast, takes the first three
regular steps. He then gives the Lance to the </em>PRIESTESS<em>, and gives the three
penal signs. He then kneels and worships the Lance with both hands. Penitential
music.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b> I am a man among men.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>He takes again the Lance, and lowers it. He rises.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b> How should I be worthy to administer the
virtues to the Brethren?</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIESTESS <em>takes from the child the water and the salt, and
mixes them in the font.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIESTESS:</b> Let the salt of Earth admonish the water to
bear the virtue of the Great Sea. <em>(Genuflects.)</em> Mother, be thou
adored.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>She returns to the West.</em> &#x2629; <em>on</em> PRIEST <em>with
open hand doth she make, over his forehead, breast, and body.</em></p>

<p class="ind">Be the PRIEST pure of body and soul!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIESTESS <em>takes the censer from the child, and places it
on the small altar. She puts incense therein.</em></p>

<p class="ind">Let the Fire and the Air make sweet the world!
<em>(Genuflects.)</em></p>

<p class="ind">Father, be thou adored!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>She returns West, and makes</em> &#x2629; <em>with the censer
before the</em> PRIEST<em>, thrice as before.</em></p>

<p class="ind">Be the PRIEST fervent of body and soul!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>(The children resume their weapons as they are done
with.)</em></p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> DEACON<em> now takes the consecrated Robe from High Altar, and
brings it to her. She robes the</em> PRIEST <em>in his Robe of scarlet and gold.</em></p>

<p class="ind">Be the flame of the Sun thine ambience, O thou PRIEST of the
SUN!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> DEACON <em>brings the crown from the High Altar. (The crown
may be of gold or platinum, or of electrum magicum; but with no other metals,
save the small proportions necessary to a proper alloy. It may be adorned with
divers jewels, at will. But it must have the Uræus serpent twined about it, and
the cap of maintenance must match the scarlet of the Robe. Its texture should
be velvet.)</em></p>

<p class="ind">Be the Serpent thy crown, O thou PRIEST of the LORD!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Kneeling, she takes the Lance, between her open hands, and
runs them up and down upon the shaft eleven times, very gently.</em></p>

<p class="ind">Be the LORD present among us!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>All give the Hailing Sign.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PEOPLE:</b> So mote it be.</p>


<p class="section">IV<br/>
Of the Ceremony<br/>
of the Opening of the Veil</p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b> Thee therefore whom we adore we also invoke.</p>

<p class="ind">By the power of the lifted Lance!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>He raises the Lance. All repeat Hailing Sign. A phrase of
triumphant music. The</em> PRIEST <em>takes the</em> PRIESTESS <em>by her right hand with his
left, keeping the Lance raised.</em></p>

<p class="ind">I, PRIEST and KING, take thee, Virgin pure without spot; I
upraise thee; I lead thee to the East; I set thee upon the summit of the
Earth.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>He thrones the</em> PRIESTESS <em>upon the altar. The</em> DEACON <em>and the
children follow, they in rank, behind him. The</em> PRIESTESS <em>takes</em> The Book of
the Law, <em>resumes her seat, and holds it open on her breast with her two
hands, making a descending triangle with thumbs and forefingers. The</em> PRIEST
<em>gives the lance to the</em> DEACON <em>to hold, and takes the ewer from the child, and
sprinkles the</em> PRIESTESS, <em>making five crosses, forehead, shoulders, and thighs.
The thumb of the</em> PRIEST <em>is always between his index and medius, whenever he is
not holding the Lance. The</em> PRIEST <em>takes the censer from the child, and makes
five crosses, as before. The children replace their weapons on their respective
altars. The</em> PRIEST <em>kisses</em> The Book of the Law <em>three times. He kneels for
a space in adoration, with joined hands, knuckles closed, thumb in position as
aforesaid. He rises and draws the veil over the whole altar. All rise and stand
to order. The</em> PRIEST <em>takes the lance from the</em> DEACON, <em>and holds it as before,
as Osiris or Pthah. He circumambulates the Temple three times, followed by the</em>
DEACON <em>and the children as before. (These, when not using their hands, keep
their arms crossed upon their breasts.) At the last circumambulation they leave
him, and go to the place between the font and the small altar, where they kneel
in adoration, their hands joined palm to palm, and raised above their heads.
All imitate this motion. The</em> PRIEST <em>returns to the East and mounts the first
step of the altar.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b>

O circle of Stars whereof our Father is but the younger brother,
marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, before whom Time is Ashamed,
the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee may we attain,
unless Thine image be Love. Therefore by seed and root and stem and bud and
leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke Thee.</p>

<p class="ind">Then the priest answered &amp; said unto the Queen of Space,
kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a
sweet-smelling perfume of sweat; O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be
ever thus; that men speak not of thee as One but as None; and let them speak
not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>During this speech the PRIESTESS must have divested herself
completely of her robe. (See CCXX I:62.)</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIESTESS:</b>

But to love me is better than all things: if under the
night-stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me,
invoking me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a
little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all;
but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall
gather goods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall
exceed the nations of the earth in splendour and pride; but always in the love
of me, &amp; so shall ye come to my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before
me in a single robe, and covered with a rich head-dress. I love you! I yearn to
you! Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple,
and drunkenness of the innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and
arouse the coiled splendour within you: come unto me! To me! To me! Sing the
rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to
me, for I love you! I love you! I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am
the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky. To me! To me!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIEST <em>mounts the second step.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b>

O secret of secrets that art hidden in the being of all that
lives, not Thee do we adore, for that which adoreth is also Thou. Thou art
That, and That am I.</p>

<p class="ind">I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core
of every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life; yet therefore is the knowledge
of me the knowledge of death. I am alone; there is no God where I am.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> DEACON <em>and all rise to their feet with the Hailing
sign.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> DEACON:</b>
But ye, O my people rise up &amp; awake.</p>
<p class="ind">Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy &amp; beauty!</p>
<p class="ind">There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.</p>
<p class="ind">A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride!</p>
<p class="ind">A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law.</p>
<p class="ind">A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet&mdash; secret, O Prophet!</p>
<p class="ind">A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.</p>
<p class="ind">A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast for death!</p>
<p class="ind">A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!</p>
<p class="ind">A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight!</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIEST <em>mounts the third step.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b>

Thou that art One, our Lord in the Universe, the Sun, our Lord in
ourselves whose name is Mystery of Mystery, uttermost being whose radiance,
enlightening the worlds, is also the breath that maketh every God even and
Death to tremble before Thee&mdash; By the Sign of Light &#x2629;
appear Thou glorious upon the throne of the Sun.</p>

<p class="ind">Make open the path of creation and of intelligence between us and
our minds. Enlighten our understanding.</p>
<p class="ind">Encourage our hearts. Let thy light
crystallize itself in our blood, fulfilling us of Resurrection.</p>

<p class="ind">A ka dua</p>
<p class="ind">Tuf ur biu</p>
<p class="ind">bi a’a chefu</p>
<p class="ind">Dudu nur af an nuteru!</p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIESTESS:</b> There is no law beyond Do what thou
wilt.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIEST <em>parts the veil with his lance. During the previous
speeches the</em> PRIESTESS <em>has, if necessary, as in savage countries, resumed her
robe.</em></p>

<p><b><em>The</em> PRIEST:</b>

ʼΊΩ ʼΊΩ ʼΊΩ ʼΙΑΩ ΣΑΒΑΩ ΚΥΡΙΗ ʼΆΒΡΑΣΑΞ ΚΥΡΙΗ ΜΕΙΘΡΑΣ ΚΥΡΙΗ ΦΑΛΛΗ.
ʼΊΩ ΠΑΝ, ʼΊΩ ΠΑΝ ΠΑΝ, ʼΊΩ ʼΙΣΧΥΡΟΝ, ʼΊΩ ʼΑΘΑΝΑΤΟΝ, ʼΊΩ ʼΆΒΡΟΤΟΝ, ʼΊΩ ʼΙΑΩ.
ΧΑΙΡΕ ΦΑΛΛΗ ΧΑΙΡΕ ΠΑΝΦΑΓΗ ΧΑΙΡΕ ΠΑΝΓΕΝΕΤΟΡ. ʽΆΓΙΟΣ, ʽΆΓΙΟΣ, ʽΆΓΙΟΣ ʼΙΑΩ. </p>

<p class="ind"><em>The</em> PRIESTESS <em>is seated with the Paten in her right hand and
the Cup in her left. The</em> PRIEST <em>presents the Lance, which she kisses eleven
times. She then holds it to her breast, while the</em> PRIEST, <em>falling at her knees,
kisses them, his arms stretched along her thighs. He remains in this adoration
while the</em> DEACON <em>intones the Collects. All stand to order, with the Dieu Garde,
that is, feet square, hands, with linked thumbs, held loosely. This is the
universal position when standing, unless other direction is given.</em></p>


<p class="section">V<br/>
