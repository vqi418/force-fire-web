        <h3>Liber CXCIV</h3>
<h1>O.T.O.<br>
An Intimation <br>
with Reference to the <br>
Constitution of the Order</h1>

<span><strong>Issued by Order:</strong></span> <span class="subtitle">BAPHOMET XI&deg; O.T.O.,<br>
HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUM BRITANNIARUM, REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUS</span>
<br><br>

<p><em>Any province of the O.T.O. is governed by the Grand Master and those to whom
he delegates his authority, until such time as the Order is established, which
is the case when it possesses eleven or more Profess-Houses in the province.
Then the regular constitution is automatically promulgated. The quotation is
slightly adapted from an address in one of the rituals.</em></p>

<p class="ind">1. This is the Constitution and Government of our Holy Order; by the study
of its Balance you may yourself come to apprehension of how to rule your own
life. For, in True Things, all are but images one of another; man is but a map
of the universe, and Society is but the same on a larger scale.</p>

<p class="ind">2. Learn then that our Holy Order has but Three True Grades; as
it is written in <i>The Book of the Law</i>: The Hermit, The Lover, and the Man
of Earth.</p>

<p class="ind">3. It is but for convenience that these grades have been
separated into Three Triads.</p>

<p class="ind">4. The Third Triad consists of the degrees from Minerval to
Prince of Jerusalem. The Minerval degree is a Prologue to the First; the
degrees subsequent to the Third but pendants to it. In this, the Man of Earth
series, there are then but Three Degrees; and these Three are One.</p>

<p class="ind">5. The Man of Earth takes no share in the Government of the
Order; for he is not yet called upon to give his life to it in service; and
with us Government is Service, and nothing else. The Man of Earth is therefore
in much the position of the Plebian in Rome in the time of Menenius Agrippa.
But there is this marked difference; that every Man of Earth is encouraged and
expected to push on to the next stage. In order that the feelings of the
general body may be represented, the Men of Earth choose four persons, two men
and two women, from among themselves, to stand continually before the face of
the Supreme and Holy King, serving him day and night. These persons must not be
of higher rank than the Second Degree; they must volunteer for this service at
the conclusion of that ceremony; and therefore they give up their own prospect
of advancement in the Order for one year, that they may serve their fellows.
This is then the first lesson in our great principle, the attainment of honour
through renunciation.</p>

<p class="ind">6. The degree of Knights of the East and West is but a bridge
between the first and second series; but it is important, for in that grade a
new pledge-form must be signed, and the new Knight vowed to devote his life to
the Establishment of the Law of Thelema.</p>

<p class="ind">7. The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that
concerns the Social welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically that of
beauty and harmony; it is the natural stopping-place of the majority of men and
women; for to proceed farther, as will appear, involves renunciation of the
sternest kind. Here then is all joy, peace, well-being on all planes; the
Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower,
and forms a natural link between them. Yet let him look to it that his eyes are
set on high!</p>

<p class="ind">8. In this degree the Most Wise Sovereign of each chapter will
appoint a committee of four persons, two men and two women, to arrange for all
social gatherings, banquets, dances, the performance of plays, and similar
pleasures. They will also endeavour to promote harmony among the Brethren in
all possible ways, and to compose any disputes by tact and friendliness without
formal appeal being made to any more authoritative tribunal.</p>

<p class="ind">9. The next grade, that which lies between the Fifth and Sixth
Degrees, is called the Senate. This is the first of the governing bodies,
properly speaking, and here we begin to insist upon Renunciation. For within
this body is the Electoral College of the O.T.O.</p>

<p class="ind">10. The principle of popular election is a fatal folly; its
results are visible in every so-called democracy. The elected man is always the
mediocrity; he is the safe man, the sound man, the man who displeases the
majority less than any other; and therefore never the genius, the man of
progress and illumination.</p>

<p class="ind">11. This Electoral College consists of Eleven Persons in each
country. It has full control of the affairs of the Men of Earth, appointing
Lodge Masters at will. It has however no authority over the Chapters of Rose
Croix.</p>

<p class="ind">12. Persons who wish to be appointed to this College by the
Supreme and Holy King must volunteer for the office. The appointment is for
Eleven Years. Volunteers must renounce for that period all further progress in
the Order. They must give evidence of first-rate ability in</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="offset-by-two eight columns">(i) Some branch of athletics.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="offset-by-two eight columns">(ii) Some branch of learning.</div>
</div>

<p class="ind">13. They must also possess a profound general knowledge of
history and of the art of government, with some attention to philosophy in
general.</p>

<p class="ind">14. They must each live in solitude, without more than the
necessary speech even to casual neighbours, serving themselves in all respects,
for three months continuously, once at least in every two years. The President
will summon them at the four seasons of the year, and if necessary at other
times, when they will deliberate upon the affairs placed in their charge. All
applications to pass to the Fifth Degree must receive their sanction. Appeal
from their decisions may however be made to the Supreme Council.</p>

<p class="ind">15. The Sixth Degree is an executive or military body, and
represents the temporal power of the Supreme and Holy King. Each member is
amenable to military discipline. Singly or in concert with his comrades, each
Knight is vowed to enforce the decisions of authority.</p>

<p class="ind">16. The Grade of Grand Inquisitor Commander follows. Here every
member has the right to a seat on the Grand Tribunal, which body decides all
disputes and complaints which have not been composed by the Chapters of Rose
Croix or the Lodge Masters. Its verdicts are without appeal, unless a member of
the Electoral College give sanction to take the case to the Areopagus of the
Eighth Degree. All members of the Order, even of higher grades, are subject to
the Grand Tribunal.</p>

<p class="ind">17. The next grade is that of Prince of the Royal Secret. Every
member of this degree is devoted to the Propagation of the Law in a very
special manner; for this grade is the first in which the Beginning of the
Inmost Secret is declared openly. He will therefore, by his personal exertions,
induce one hundred and eleven persons to join the Order, before he may proceed
to the Seventh Degree, except by special order from the Supreme and Holy
King.</p>

<p class="ind">18. The Seventh Degree is, in military language, the Great
General Staff of the Army of the Sixth Degree. From its members the Supreme and
Holy King appoints a Supreme Grand Council.</p>

<p class="ind">19. This Council is charged with the government of the whole of
the Second Triad, or Lovers. All members of the Seventh Degree travel as
Sovereign Grand Inspectors General of the Order, and report, on their own
initiative, to the Supreme and Most Holy King, as to the condition of all
Lodges, and Chapters; to the Supreme Council, on all affairs of the Second
Triad; and to the Electoral College, on those of the Third.</p>

<p class="ind">20. The Eighth Degree is a Philosophical Body. Its members being
fully instructed in the Principles of the Order, save in one point only, devote
themselves to the understanding of what they have learned in their initiation.
They have power to reverse the decisions of the Grand Tribunal, and to compose
all conflicts between any of the governing bodies. And this they do upon the
great principles of philosophy. For it will often occur that there is
contention between two parties, both of whom are right from their own point of
view. This is so important that an illustration is desirable. A man is smitten
with leprosy; is it right that men should circumscribe his liberty by isolating
him from his fellows? Another holds back land or some other necessity from the
common use; is he to be compelled to surrender it? Such cases of difficulty
involve deep philosophical principles; and the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree
is charged with the duty of resolving them in accordance with the great
principles of the Order.</p>

<p class="ind">21. Before the face of the Areopagus stands an independent
Parliament of the Guilds. Within the Order, irrespective of grade, the members
of each craft, trade, science, or profession form themselves into a Guild, make
their own laws, and prosecute their own good, in all matters pertaining to
their labour and means of livelihood. Each Guild chooses the man most eminent
in it to represent it before the Areopagus of the Eighth Degree; and all
disputes between the various Guilds are argued before that Body, which will
decide according to the grand principles of the Order. Its decisions pass for
ratification to the Sanctuary of the Gnosis, and thence to the Throne.</p>

<p class="ind">22. Epopts and Pontiffs of this exalted grade are bound to live
in isolation for four consecutive months in every year, meditating the
mysteries revealed to them.</p>

<p class="ind">23. The Ninth Degree&mdash; the Sanctuary of the Gnosis&mdash; is
synthetic. The prime duty of its members is to study and practise the theurgy
and thaumaturgy of the grade; but in addition they must be prepared to act as
direct representatives of the Supreme and Most Holy King, radiating his light
upon the whole world. Yet, from the nature of their initiation, they must veil
their glory in a cloud of darkness. They move unseen and unrecognized among the
youngest of us, subtly and loftily leading us into the holy ineffable mysteries
of the True Light.</p>

<p class="ind">24. The Supreme and Most Holy King is appointed by the O.H.O. His
is the ultimate responsibility for all within his holy kingdom. The succession
to the high office of O.H.O. is decided in a manner not here to be declared;
but this you may learn, O Brother Magician, that he may be chosen even from the
grade of a Minerval. And herein lieth a most sacred Mystery.</p>

<p class="ind">25. The Electoral College possesses one most singular power.
Every eleven years, or in the case of a vacancy occurring, they choose two
persons from the Ninth Degree, who are charged with the duty of Revolution.</p>

<p class="ind">26. It is the business of these persons constantly to criticise
and oppose the acts of the Supreme and Most Holy King, whether or no they
personally approve of them. Should he exhibit weakness, bodily, mental, or
moral, they are empowered to appeal to the O.H.O. to depose him; but they,
alone of all the members of the Order, are not eligible to the Succession.</p>

<p class="ind">27. The O.H.O., as the supreme authority in the Order, will act,
in such an emergency, as he may see fit. He may himself be removed from office,
but only by the unanimous vote of all the members of the Tenth Degree.</p>

<p class="ind">28. Of the Eleventh Degree, its powers, privileges, and
qualifications, nothing whatever is said in any grade. It has no relation to
the general plan of the Order, is inscrutable, and dwells in its own
Palaces.</p>

<p class="ind">29. There are certain important financial obligations in various
grades.</p>

<p class="ind">30. The Electoral College of the Senate is vowed to poverty. All
property, earnings, or salaries are vested in or paid over to the Grand
Treasurer General. The members subsist on the charity of the Order, which is
extended to them in accordance with their original rank in life.</p>

<p class="ind">31. These remarks apply equally to the Supreme Grand Council, and
all higher degrees.</p>

<p class="ind">32. In the Seventh Degree it is a qualification to vest some real
property in the Order; and no one is admitted to this grade without this
preliminary.</p>

<p class="ind">33. Those members of the Order who have given all to it must
obtain the money for their initiation fees and subscriptions from the Third
Triad, whose honour is thus concerned in the unselfish support of those who
have abandoned all for their sakes.</p>

<p class="ind">34. The Grand Treasurer General is appointed by the Supreme and
Most Holy King; he may be a member of any grade whatever; but he must, on
accepting office, take the vow of poverty. His authority is absolute in all
financial matters; but he is responsible to, and may be removed at will by, the
Supreme and Most Holy King. He will appoint a committee to assist him and
advise him in his work; and he will usually select one person from each of the
governing bodies of the Order.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Such is a brief outline of the government of the O.T.O. It
combines monarchy with democracy; it includes aristocracy, and conceals even
the seeds of revolution, by which alone progress can be effected. Thus we
balance the Triads, uniting the Three in One; thus we gather up all the threads
of human passion and interest, and weave them into an harmonious tapestry,
subtly and diligently with great art, that our Order may seem an ornament even
to the Stars that are in the Heavens at Night. In our rainbow-coloured texture
we set forth the glory of the whole Universe&mdash; See thou to it, brother
Magician, that thine own thread be strong, and pure, and of a colour brilliant
in itself, yet ready to mingle in all beauty with those of thy brethren!</em></p>
