	<h1 class="underline-center">Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica</h1>
	<p class="left-xlarge">The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica or Gnostic Catholic 
	Church is a Thelemic <span>Ecclesiastic</span> body within the Ordo Templi Orientis.</p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">The Gnostic Church was founded by Jules-Beno&icirc;t 
	Stanislas Doinel du Val-Michel (1842-1903) assuming the office of Patriarch 
	in 1890. As Patriarch Doinel took the mystic name Valentin II and proceeded 
	to consecrate several bishops. The bishops of Doinel's Gnostic Church all 
	chose a mystic name prefaced by the Greek letter Tau.&nbsp; Two of the 
	original bishops made by Doinel were: G&eacute;rard Encausse (1865-1916) as 
	Tau Vincent, Bishop of Toulouse, and Louis-Sophrone Fugairon (born 1846) as 
	Tau Sophronius, Bishop of B&eacute;ziers. Eventually these two bishops 
	joined a schismatic branch of the Gnostic Church (l'&Eacute;glise Catholique 
	Gnostique or <em>the Gnostic Catholic Church</em>) founded by a third, later 
	consecrated bishop: Jean Bricaud (1881-1934). </p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">In June of 1908 it is believed that G&eacute;rard 
	Encausse bestowed episcopal and primatial authority in l'&Eacute;glise 
	Catholique Gnostique on Theodor Reuss (1855-1923) who incorporated it into 
	the Ordo Templi Orientis of which he was the Outer Head.<br />
	Jean Bricaud passed apostolic succession through the Joseph Ren&eacute; 
	Vilatte line (Antioch succession) to Theodor Reuss on September 18, 1919.</p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">Theodor Reuss appointed Aleister Crowley National 
	Grand Master X&ordm; for Ireland, Iona, and all the Britains in 1912. 
	Crowley created <a href="http://lib.oto-usa.org/libri/liber0015.html">Liber XV the <em>Gnostic Mass</em></a><em> </em>in 1913 which Reuss 
	published in 1918 under the auspices of the OTO representing a formal 
	acceptance of the Law of Thelema.</p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">Aleister Crowley succeeded Reuss as Outer Head of the 
	OTO and leader of the Thelemic Gnostic Catholic Church in 1922.</p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">Although several valid lines of apostolic succession 
	exist within Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, Christian apostolic succession is 
	not required of The Episcopate, or of particular relevance as sacerdotal 
	authority is derived from succession from the Prophet of Thelema: Aleister 
	Crowley. Having apostolic succession does not make one a member of the 
	E.G.C. or confer any rights or privileges therein.</p>
	<p class="left-xlarge"><span class="font-xlarge">The central activity of the 
	E.G.C. is the celebration of the Gnostic Mass, </span><em>
	<span class="font-xlarge">Liber XV</span></em><span class="font-xlarge">.&nbsp; 
	Membership in E.G.C. is available through baptism and confirmation.</span></p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">As it exists today our Church has two classifications 
	of membership: Lay membership (people who have been baptized and confirmed), 
	and the Clergy (the Patriarch, the Primates, the Bishops, the Priests and 
	Priestesses, and the Deacons.)</p>
	<p class="left-xlarge">The Patriarch is the Father (or Mother) of the 
	Church. This office is held by the Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis.<br />
	The Primates are Presiding Bishops and are the National Grand Masters 
	General X° of various countries.<br />
	Bishops within E.G.C. must be Sovereign Grand Inspectors General VII° of 
	O.T.O. <br />
	Priests and Priestesses of the E.G.C. hold the degree of Knight of the East 
	and West (KEW), the first of the invitational degrees in the Ordo Templi 
	Orientis.<br />
	E.G.C. Deacons must be O.T.O. initiate members of the II°.</p>
	<p class="font-xlarge">Members of O.T.O. in good standing are eligible for 
	clerical training and ordination in E.G.C.&nbsp; Many O.T.O. local bodies 
	celebrate the Gnostic Mass on a regular basis. Usually individuals not 
	initiated in O.T.O. are welcome to attend Mass, although visitors are 
	expected to communicate the sacrament.</p>
