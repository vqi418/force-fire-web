	<h1 class="underline-center-normal"><strong>About the O.T.O.</strong></h1>
	<span class="font-xlarge">
	Ordo Templi Orientis is the first of the great Old 
	Æon orders to accept The Book of the Law, received by Aleister Crowley in 
	1904 EV. This book proclaims a New Æon in human thought, culture and 
	religion. The Æon arises from a single supreme injunction: the Law of 
	Thelema, which is Do what thou wilt.
	
	<br />
	<br />
	This Law is not to be interpreted as a license to 
	indulge every passing whim, but rather as the mandate to discover one’s True 
	Will and accomplish it; leaving others to do the same in their own unique 
	ways. “Every man and every woman is a star.” The Law of Thelema can 
	ultimately be fulfilled only through the individual efforts of each person. 
	Nevertheless, many worthy aspirants to the Great Work of Thelema have a 
	genuine need for information, guidance, fellowship, or the opportunity to 
	assist their fellow aspirants and serve humanity. Such aspirants will find 
	welcome in O.T.O.</span><br class="font-xlarge" />
	<br class="font-xlarge" />
	<span class="font-xlarge">O.T.O. was originally affiliated with European 
	Masonry but is no longer a Masonic organization, though it shares some 
	terminology and traditions with Masonry. The complex but intriguing history 
	of O.T.O. may be of interest for the light it sheds on the origins of our 
	current organization and goals.</span><br class="font-xlarge" />
	<br class="font-xlarge" />
	<span class="font-xlarge">The O.T.O. operates local bodies throughout the 
	world; most members participate directly in one or more of them. There are 
	three levels of local bodies within the O.T.O.: Camps, Oases, and Lodges, in 
	order of increasing importance and services available. Most local bodies 
	offer classes on magick, ritual, cabala, and other topics of interest to 
	practicing Thelemites. Many bodies perform the Gnostic Mass on a regular 
	basis. Other common local activities include performance of group rituals 
	(for example, the Rites of Eleusis), publication of a newsletter or journal, 
	and cooperative activities with other local alternative-religious groups.</span>
	<p class="underline-center-xlarge"><strong>Joining O.T.O.</strong></p>
	<p class="text-left"><span class="font-xlarge">For those who wish to join 
	our fraternity, O.T.O. offers a staged series of initiations, or degrees. 
	These are physical ceremonies performed at local Lodges, Oases and some 
	Camps. In the 
	rituals of these degrees, O.T.O. seeks to instruct the individual by 
	allegory and symbol in the profound mysteries of nature, and thereby to 
	assist each initiate in discovering his or her own true identity.</span><br class="font-xlarge" />
	<br class="font-xlarge" />
	<span class="font-xlarge">Membership in the O.T.O. begins with the 
	Minerval, or 0 degree initiation. This is an introductory, probationary 
	Degree, which does not establish any permanent fraternal bonds with our 
	Order. It offers the participant a chance to experience our mysteries as a 
	guest without any long-term membership commitment. More information on the 
	Minerval Degree can be found in the
	<a href="http://amonra.thelema.ca/minerval-faq/">Minerval Frequently Asked 
	Questions</a> document.&nbsp; Information on the complete degree structure 
	of O.T.O. can be found on the Canadian National website:
	<a href="http://www.oto-canada.org/OTOMember.html">
	http://www.oto-canada.org/OTOMember.html</a> and a history of the Order can 
	be found at: <a href="http://oto-usa.org/oto/history/">
	http://oto-usa.org/oto/history/</a>.&nbsp; </span><br class="font-xlarge" />
	<br class="font-xlarge" />
	<span class="font-xlarge">Initiate membership is available to every man and 
	woman who is free (that is, not incarcerated), at least 18 years old, and of 
	good report. In order to establish "good report", your application must be 
	signed by two sponsors who are already I° initiates of O.T.O. Prospective 
	sponsors will generally want to get to know you before signing your 
	application.<br />
	<br />
	Individuals seeking initiation should contact an officer of the Oasis:
	<a href="contact.html">Contacts</a>&nbsp; <br />
	or arrange to attend a public event: <a href="http://www.lot.thelema.ca">
