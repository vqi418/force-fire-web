        <h1>Thelema</h1>
        <div class="ctr">
<p>&ldquo;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&rdquo; (Liber AL vel Legis I 40)<br/>
&ldquo;There is no Law beyond Do what thou wilt.&rdquo;<br/>
&ldquo;The word of the Law is &Theta;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mu;&alpha;.&rdquo; (Liber AL vel Legis I 39)<br/>
&Theta;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mu;&alpha;&mdash; Thelema&mdash; means Will.</p>
</div>
        <p>Thelema (&Theta;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta;&mu;&alpha;) is the Greek word meaning "Will". </p>
        
        
        
        <p>From Blazing Star Oasis - San Francisco Bay Area, California http://blazingstar-oto.org/</p>
<h2>Thoughtfulness and the rejection of blind faith</h2>
<p>Thelema inspires free thinking, skepticism, and the scientific-method over blind faith, which Crowley defined as “acceptance of any statement as true without criticism, examination, verification, or any other method of test.” Thelemites very rarely believe something “just because.” This is why Thelema is often thought of as a Gnostic religion. Gnosis is Greek for “knowledge,” and as as such, Thelemites are expected to adopt beliefs either through the process of direct experience and substantiation or based on their usefulness in the individual’s spiritual labors.</p>
<h2>Human Divinity</h2>
<p>Thelema utterly rejects the notion of original sin, and states, rather, that we are all divine creatures—“Every man and every woman is a star” (AL I:5). Therefore, Thelema renounces such states as guilt, shame, and pity, and instead promotes positive virtues, such as honor, pride, and courage. Thelema also does not recognize any personified source of evil, such as the Judeo-Christian Satan, nor any need for “personal salvation.” Rather, Thelemites are encouraged to discover their own divinity—a Thelemite does not want to have faith in God, she wants to know God, and eventually come to realize that she IS God.</p>
<h2>Love & Sacred Sexuality</h2>
<p>Thelema—which is Greek for Will—is paired with Agape, the Greek word for Love. Love, from a mystical point of view, is the drive to achieve Union, thereby losing the sense of ego-individuality and isolation. This theme is repeated often within Thelema, and is considered to be the key to accomplishing the Great Work. This is reflected in the core expression of Thelema from The Book of the Law:</p>
<div class="ind">Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. (AL I:40)</div>
 <div class="ind">Love is the law, love under will. (AL I:57)</div><br>

<p>This notion of divine Love is personified in the Thelemic deities Nuit and Hadit, who represent (respectively) the infinitely-expanded Goddess of the Night Sky and the infinitely-condensed masculine Point, the hidden Flame in the being of all that lives. Their Union results in the birth of Ra-Hoor-Khuit (or Horus), the Hawk-Headed sun god, called the Crowned and Conquering Child.
As such, Thelema recognizes that the fundamental nature of the Universe is creative, which is reflected and embodied in the act of sex. As such, consensual lovemaking is considered to be a sacrament, and can even be used for personal devotional or transformational rites. By extension, the absolute freedom for all consenting adults to engage in sex as they Will is an important cultural value within Thelema.</p>
<h2>Independence and Liberty</h2>
<p>While many Thelemites recognize that humans are socially and biologically interdependent, Thelema requires that one also aspire to self-reliance and a sense of personal responsibility for one’s own actions and well-being. Also, Thelemites tend to be suspicious of authority, often choosing their own unique paths. As such, deeply embedded within Thelema is the value of Liberty—to make one’s own choices about major life issues, such as career, sexual partners, and creative expression. Very importantly, Thelemites strive to avoid interfering in anyone else’s process of discovering and expressing their own Will, recognizing that this only leads to confusion and disharmony.
Thelemites promulgate the Law, but do not convert
Practices such as proselytizing and conversion are strongly discouraged within Thelema, since Thelemites hold that interpretation of The Book of the Law is a task strictly for the individual. At the same time, many undertake the duty of promulgating the general principles of Liber Legis (as outlined above), thereby spreading the Law of Liberty. The object is to inspire others to acknowledge their own unique Will and then to attempt to discover and express it.</p>

From OTO USGL http://oto-usa.org/thelema/:

Thelema emphasizes individualism, and the uniqueness of each person’s Will. As a result, it is very difficult to make blanket statements about its nature or (still more so) the natures of its adherents. Even the label “religion” fits Thelema awkwardly in some contexts — it is in other senses a philosophy and a way of life, while also overlapping with the set of practices and symbols commonly called “Magick”.
